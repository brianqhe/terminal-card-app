# Ride the Bus Terminal App

## Statement of purpose and scope

#### About this application
---

The purpose of this application is provide an entertainment platform between a group of colleagues or friends so that they can play a friendly and simple game. The application consists of a card game whereby random cards are generated from a deck of cards and the player will have to pass through 4 levels to win the game. These levels consist of the following 

### Level 1
The player will attempt to guess whether the first card dealt will be red or black, with hearts and diamonds being red, and spades and clubs being black.

### Level 2
Based on the first card dealt, the player will then have to guess whether their second card is higher or lower than their first card.

### Level 3
Based on the first and second cards, the player will have to guess whether their third card is within or outside their previous two cards. For example, if the first two cards at 2 and 7, the cards 3/4/5/6 would be inside, and the cards would be outside.

#### Level 4
The final level will require the player to guess the suit of their final card (i.e. Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs)

Once the player has passed all the levels, they will have won the game. However, if the player gets any of the levels wrong, they will have to go back to level 1 and start again, and it will count as having taken one turn.The player who took the highest number of turns to "Ride the Bus" loses the game. The punishments for the loser currently all incorporate fitness based punishments such as pushups, situps and burpees, but these can be ignored and different punishments can be thought of instead.


#### Problem and reason for development
---

There are many times when card games want to be played but cards are simply not available or if there is no Internet connection to play any online based multiplayer games. This application will serve as a solution for a group of friends to play a simple card game with a scoring system in place. The game incorporates an element of statistical probabilities and also luck, in a way that the player needs to identify the most likely scenario in their game. For example, in level 2, if the first card dealt was a 3 of diamonds, statistically it would be much more likely for the next card to be higher and not lower. 

#### Target audience and use
---

The target audience will be friends or colleagues in a group that want to participate in a group activity where everyone can get involved.

A group of friends or colleagues can sit around in a group and take turns at playing Ride the Bus, with observers being just as engrossed as the player themselves. The scoreboard can be displayed through the main menu to show the current standings. While players may pick the most statistically probable option, there are times when the slim probability can still occur, resulting in surprising results and lots of fun.
